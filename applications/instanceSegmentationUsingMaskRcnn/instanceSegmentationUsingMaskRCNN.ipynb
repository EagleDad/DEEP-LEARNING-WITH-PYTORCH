First, lets understand instance segmentation. Instance segmentation task is the labelling of each foreground pixel with object and instance.\n","\n","**Instant Segmentation -> Object Detection + Semantic Segmentation**\n","\n","Instance Segmentation is challenging because it requires the correct detection of all objects in an image while also precisely segmenting each instance. It therefore combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection, where the goal is to classify individual objects and localize each using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel into a fixed set of categories without differentiating object instances.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://www.learnopencv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/c3-w11-instance-egmentation.png\" width=1000>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Hup-KDK8M0tR"},"source":["#  <font style=\"color:green\">1. Model</font>\n","\n","Now, lets understand how Mask RCNN performs instance segmentation. **Mask RCNN** extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition.\n","\n","In brief, **Faster RCNN**  consists of two stages. The first stage, called a Region Proposal Network (RPN),\n","proposes candidate object bounding boxes. The second stage, which is in essence Fast R-CNN, extracts features using RoIPool from each candidate box and performs classification and bounding-box regression. Mask R-CNN adopts the same two-stage procedure, with an identical first stage (which is RPN). In the second stage, in parallel to predicting the class and box offset, Mask R-CNN also outputs a binary mask for each RoI.\n","\n","Lets see how we can train custom object using detectron2 and pretrained Mask RCNN model.

In `2018`, it has released OpenImages `V4` which included `15.4M` bounding-boxes for `600` object categories, making it the largest existing dataset with object location annotations, as well as over `300k` visual relationship annotations. Recently, it has released Open Images `V5`, which adds segmentation masks to the set of annotations.\n","\n","Open Images `V5` features segmentation masks for `2.8 million` object instances in `350` categories. Unlike bounding-boxes, which only identify regions in which an object is located, segmentation masks mark the outline of objects, characterizing their spatial extent to a much higher level of detail. Importantly, these masks cover a broader range of object categories and a larger total number of instances than any previous dataset.\n","\n","**For instance segmentation, COCO format will have json containing all the images, segmentations information.
