Based on this, the system can:\n","- Count each full push-up repetition\n","\n","## Application Scope\n","\n","This project is designed to run **exclusively on a pre-recorded video file** (e.g., `.mp4`). It does not require live input from a webcam. This setup makes the project ideal for:\n","- Post-session training analysis\n","- Sports science demonstrations\n","- Educational use in computer vision and human activity recognition\n","\n","## Workflow Overview\n","\n","1. **Setup**: Install and configure Detectron2 in Google Colab.\n","2. **Import Libraries**:\n","3. **Model Configuration**: Load a pre-trained Keypoint R-CNN model (trained on COCO).\n","4. **Helper functions**:\n","\n","## Requirements\n","\n","- A suitable push-up video with clear, full-body visibility\n","- Google Colab (with GPU support recommended for faster inference)\n","- Interest in combining fitness and AI for movement analysis"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import
