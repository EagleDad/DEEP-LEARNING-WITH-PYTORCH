Any TorchScript program can be saved from a Python process and loaded in a process where there is no Python dependency. For example, a model trained using PyTorch can be serialized and saved using TorchScript, and that serialized models can be loaded and used in the `C++` code.\n","\n","It makes it possible to train a model in PyTorch in an eager model, then exports the model to the production environment, where the python program may be disadvantageous for performance and multi-threading reasons.\n","\n","**We need TorchScript for the portability and performance of a PyTorch model:**\n","\n","**Portability:** Models should be exportable to a wide verity of different environments, such as `C++`, mobile, embedded systems, etc. However, a tight couple with a  python environment makes it difficult.\n","\n","**Performance:** Common patterns in the neural network can be optimized further to improve inference latency and throughput. However, numerous other optimization techniques can not be applied due to the level of python's dynamism.\n","\n","\n","**TorchScript does not just make the PyTorch model portable but also optimize it. How does TorchScript optimize the model?**\n","\n","We know that the compiler optimizes the codes by converting codes to machine-friendly language (mostly bytecode) that speed up the execution. However, python is an interpreter language that executes code directly that leads to a compromise in execution speed. The TorchScript usage a concept called [JIT](http://aboullaite.me/understanding-jit-compiler-just-in-time-compiler/#:~:text=The%20JIT%20compiler%20is%20enabled,directly%20instead%20of%20interpreting%20it.) (Just-In-Time) compiler that runs with the interpreter and optimizes specific regions of the code, which are called hot components (loops, function calls) and converts into machine code. While executing the code with the interpreter, the machine-code generated by JIT-compiler will be executed instead of the interpreter output that makes execution fast.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Torchscript develops an intermediate representation (IR) in the form of a graph similar to [LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/index.html) and uses the JIT compiler to optimize this intermediate representation.**\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mYgoh0Qfqj44"},"source":["There is an example of intermediate representation (IR) for adding two tensors.\n","\n","```\n","graph(%a : Long(),\n","      %b : Long()):\n","  %2 : int = prim::Constant[value=1]()\n","  %3 : Long() = aten::add(%a, %b, %2)\n","  return (%3)\n","```\n","\n","The intermediate representation (**IR**) used in the TorchScript has many components that you can find [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/53af9df557aff745edf24193ece784fd008c6f19/torch/csrc/jit/OVERVIEW.md). In this notebook, instead of going into theoretical details (not required to use TorchScript), we will see how the TorchScript transforms the PyTorch model to an intermediate graph representation (IR) and save the IR. We will also see how to load the IR model in python.
